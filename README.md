## Project description

Goal of this project was to expand my programming experience and broaden my knowledge about web development. To do it I've experimented with various technologies, such as NextJS static site generation, Firebase Auth and Firestore, a bit of Typescript and various react libraries such as Styled Components and Framer Motion, with deployment ending on Vercel.
